Of all the applications of machine-learning, diagnosing any serious disease using a black box is always going to be a hard sell. If the output from a model is the particular course of treatment (potentially with side-effects), or surgery, or the absence of treatment, people are going to want to know why.

This dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease.
We'll do exploratory data analysis on the dataset first and then implement ML models and compare them to see which one performs the best.
